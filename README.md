### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.
```sql

 job_schedule_type,
 salary_year_avg,

FROM 
 job_postings_fact 
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
 job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
 job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
 salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10 
```
